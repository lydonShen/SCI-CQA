<p>

SCI-CQA address the limitations of current benchmarks and provide a more robust framework for evaluating the chart understanding abilities of multimodal models in scientific literature contexts.

- ✨ SCI-CQA highlights flowcharts, a crucial yet often overlooked chart type in scientific literature, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks that primarily focus on simpler chart types.
- ✨ By using real-world scientific charts with intricate visual elements, SCI-CQA offers a more accurate assessment of multimodal models, addressing the shortcomings of existing benchmarks that rely on overly simplistic elements.
- ✨ SCI-CQA introduces an evaluation framework inspired by human exams, featuring 5,629 carefully curated questions that include both objective and open-ended formats, enhancing the assessment of model understanding beyond simplistic templates.
- ✨ The benchmark emphasizes the importance of contextual information in chart understanding, demonstrating how context can help answer previously unanswerable questions, thereby setting a new standard for evaluating multimodal models.
- ✨ A new annotation pipeline is proposed that significantly reduces the costs associated with data annotation, making the process more efficient and scalable.



# Dataset 

SCI-CQA will be released in this Link. In addition, we create a large training dataset of chart understanding, which will be published here. [HF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lyndons1/SCI-CQA).



# Evaluation
Coming Soon!
